Workouts application created using MERN (Mongo db, Express , React.js, Node.js),

I have created an appliaction in which you can add or manage your workouts as needed, also Implemented User Authentication for which every user can have a seperate access to is 
record or account

In this application i mainly focused on functionalities of React.Js and Express.Js.
I have used UseContext and also created my own customized hooks, I have used a global state to perform CRUD within React.js that updates my global state useReducer in my
useContext hook.
I have created different Types of hooks for Authentication and to Manage the Workouts interacting with the backend.

Also dont forget to view the link of this project that i have uploaded.
